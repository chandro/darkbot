/* Darkbot Todo list */

- Make google function work again.

- Make topics use variable as well as topic replies so I can make
  something like "hey+B~,+wassup blah blah", and you can make bot 
  respond to it's own name no matter what nick it's using without
  adding extra topics. Just example. Make all vars work.

- Restructure chanserv() function. Badly needs done.
