/* Darkbot Todo list */

- Make randomstuff timers independent for each room the bot is in.

- Improve database search speed, stuff like that. Maybe start 
  sorting info2.db and decide which end of file to start 
  scanning from by the letter the search starts with?? 

- Make google function work again.

- Improve statistics tracking.

- Improve memory usage output.

- Weather function.

- Make topics use variable as well as topic replies so I can make
  something like "hey+B~,+wassup blah blah", and you can make bot 
  respond to it's own name no matter what nick it's using without
  adding extra topics. Just example. Make all vars work.

- Restructure chanserv() function. Badly needs done.
